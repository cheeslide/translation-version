# Translation Version

**Translation Version** is a CLI tool that:

1. Retrieves the corresponding version of the original text from the translation file (currently using regular expressions).  
2. Searches the history of the original text.  
3. Outputs the results.

## Credit

Thanks to the libraries that the tool depends on, check Cargo.toml for a list. Among them we especially give credits to [libgit2](https://libgit2.org/) and its rust bindings [git2 crate](https://docs.rs/crate/git2/latest).
