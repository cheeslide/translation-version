# Translation Version

**Translation Version** is a CLI tool that:

1. Retrieves the corresponding version of the original text from the translation file (currently using regular expressions).  
2. Searches the history of the original text.  
3. Outputs the results.

It is currently under development; contributions and issue reports are welcome.

## Credit
